#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡
# write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100. Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:

total = 0
for number in range(2,101,2):
  total += number
print(total)


addition = 0
for number in range(1,101):
  if number % 2 == 0:
   addition += number
print(addition)


add =2+4+6+8
print(add)
